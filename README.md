## Design for a Dynamic Chatbot Application Using Python Flask

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires a dynamic chatbot application that can display multiple panels of information in response to user questions, while maintaining a history of conversations and user preferences.

### Flask Application Structure

**HTML Files:**

- **index.html**: Main page of the application, which contains the chatbot interface.
- **chat_history.html**: Separate page to display the history of conversations.
- **preferences.html**: Page to allow users to set their preferences for the chatbot.

**Routes:**

- `/`: Main route that renders the **index.html** page.
- `/chat_history`: Route for the chat history page, which fetches the conversation history and renders the **chat_history.html** page.
- `/preferences`: Route for the preferences page, which allows users to update their preferences and renders the **preferences.html** page.
- `/chatbot`: Core route that handles chatbot interactions. It takes the user's question as input, processes it, and returns the appropriate response.
- `/update_preferences`: Route that handles updates to user preferences based on the input from the preferences page.

**Logic:**

The core logic of the chatbot is implemented in the `/chatbot` route. It should:

- Parse the user's question.
- Query a knowledge base to find the most relevant information.
- Generate a response based on the retrieved information.
- Update the conversation history.
- Handle user preferences.

### Deployment

Once the application is developed, it should be deployed on a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to make it accessible to users over the web.

### Additional Considerations

- **Database**: Consider using a database to store conversation history and user preferences persistently.
- **Session management**: Implement session management to maintain the user's state across multiple requests.
- **Security**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data.
